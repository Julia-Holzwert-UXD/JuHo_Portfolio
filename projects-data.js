          summary:
            "OFFLINE is an interactive exhibition concept for the Museum für Kommunikation Berlin. Across seven connected spaces, visitors experience notification pressure, delayed responses, orientation without GPS, outsourced memory, and communication through movement, objects, light, sound, and other people.",

          challenge:
            "The challenge was turning digital absence into a physical experience. Being offline can feel like rejection, relief, uncertainty, or intentional distance. A screen-led exhibition would contradict the subject, while a simple digital-detox message would ignore how complex communication has become.",

          approach:
            "I developed the curatorial premise, seven-room visitor journey, physical interaction principles, accessibility approach, environmental identity, and key installations. The route moves from overload and interruption to waiting, disorientation, memory, shared presence, and conscious reconnection.",

          creativeDirection:
            "OFFLINE is positioned as a communication exhibition rather than a wellness campaign or technology showcase. Displays are replaced by paper, mechanical indicators, directional sound, light, distance, waiting, and collective action. Historical communication objects connect current digital behaviour with earlier expectations around speed, memory, and availability.",

          keyVisualSystem:
            "Warm paper white, carbon black, and signal orange form the visual system. A broken horizontal line connects the wordmark, room sequence, signage, tactile guidance, and installations. The identity begins dense and fragmented, then becomes quieter and more open as visitors move through the exhibition.",

          result: [
            "Spatial Experience Architecture: Defined a seven-room journey from digital overload to conscious reconnection.",
            "Interaction Beyond Displays: Used movement, waiting, sound, paper, mechanical objects, light, and cooperation as interface materials.",
            "Museum Integration: Connected contemporary communication behaviour with historical objects and changing communication systems.",
            "Inclusive Experience Principles: Included low-stimulus routes, multisensory cues, optional participation, and equivalent interaction paths.",

          challenge:

          approach:
            "I owned the HUD information architecture and interaction logic, translating phone setup, navigation, calls, rear camera access, and safety warnings into task flows and screen states. We tested with 12 participants and found that users hesitated on the start screen due to equal visual weight between setup and transfer actions — leading to a clearer hierarchy, improved wording, and a saved profile overview.",

Decorative motion and dashboard density were stripped to reduce cognitive load under driving pressure.",

            "CampusTalk is a mobile web app that helps students reflect on prejudice through guided quizzes, anonymous discussion, and curated learning content. The platform avoids accusatory language and uses structured participation to make sensitive topics feel safer and easier to enter.",

          challenge:
            "The core challenge was reducing defensiveness. Students needed recognition and safe ways to share real experiences, while outsiders needed low pressure entry points that would not make them feel attacked. The second challenge was information overload: too much text, too many features, or an overly moral tone would make users leave before reflection could happen.",

          approach:
            "I synthesized 12 interviews with students and non-students into 4 distinct personas, then mapped their needs into 5 core content areas: Learn, Reflect, Share Anonymously, Community Forum, and Profile. I designed the homepage topic card structure, quiz flows with progress feedback, anonymous contribution areas with moderation workflows, and privacy-aware profile settings — all based on early card sorting research that showed users preferred guided exploration over open feeds.",

          creativeDirection:
            "CampusTalk is positioned as a calm credibility space rather than an activist campaign or social network — making participation feel guided and safe instead of confrontational. Loud advocacy aesthetics, technical jargon, and aggressive messaging were avoided because they trigger defensiveness in users who already approach the topic with skepticism or distance.",

            "The visual system uses violet (#6E368C) as the primary identity, giving the platform a reflective and educational character without feeling institutional or political.

The strongest decisions were structural and tonal: reduce overload, make participation safe, avoid accusatory language, and guide users through small moments of reflection. It also clarified my strongest role in group projects. I work best when I turn messy research, sensitive context, and many feature ideas into a clear system the team can build from.",

        sections: {
          summary:
            "“Users should be able to understand, manage, and end a subscription without friction.” This independent concept redesign examines the DAZN subscription experience through the lens of transparency and user control. It focuses on plan selection, billing clarity, account management, cancellation, and retention offers. The goal was to create a subscription journey that supports conversion while making costs, terms, and exit options easy to understand.",

          challenge:
            "DAZN offers different subscription plans, payment models, and commitment periods. This creates a high-stakes decision for users, especially when price, contract duration, renewal dates, and included sports content need to be compared quickly. The challenge was to simplify the full subscription lifecycle without reducing DAZN’s ability to retain customers, promote relevant plans, and communicate the value of its sports offering.",

          approach:
            "I mapped the journey from plan discovery to cancellation and identified moments where users could lose context or feel pressured. The redesign introduced a central subscription hub that shows the active plan, monthly price, billing cycle, next payment date, commitment period, and available account actions in one place. Plan comparisons use consistent language and a clear overview of included content. Cancellation becomes a direct account action with a visible end date, a clear confirmation state, and optional retention offers that can be skipped without friction. The concept uses plain-language microcopy to explain every financial and contractual decision before users confirm it.",

          creativeDirection:
            "The creative direction reframes DAZN subscription management as a confident and transparent part of the streaming experience. The interface keeps the energy of live sport, but applies it with disciplined hierarchy, direct language, and clear decision points. Subscription information becomes readable at a glance. Prices, contract terms, renewal dates, and cancellation options remain visible instead of being treated as secondary account details. Retention offers appear as optional alternatives, such as pausing, changing plans, or receiving a limited promotion. They never block the user from continuing. The redesign treats clarity as a brand asset. It shows that a premium sports platform can protect revenue while giving users control over their membership.",

          keyVisualSystem:
            "The visual system builds on DAZN’s bold sports identity while introducing a calmer structure for account decisions. Strong black and white contrast creates a direct, high-confidence interface. Bright accent colour is reserved for primary actions, live status, and key subscription information. Large plan cards make price, duration, and included content scannable. Clear spacing separates commercial choices from account controls. Progress indicators, confirmation states, and calm microcopy reduce uncertainty during plan changes and cancellation.",

          result: [
            "Clear Subscription Overview: Users can view their active plan, billing date, payment amount, contract duration, and included content from one account screen.",
            "Transparent Plan Decisions: Monthly and annual options are easier to compare because price, commitment period, renewal behaviour, and included sports content follow one consistent structure.",
            "Respectful Retention Flow: Cancellation remains accessible while downgrade, pause, and offer options are presented as optional alternatives instead of barriers.",
            "Stronger Trust Signal: Direct language and visible account controls position transparency as part of the DAZN product experience.",
            "Business-Aligned UX: The redesign supports conversion and retention through relevant value communication rather than unclear contract details or pressured decision-making.",

          takeaway:
            "Subscription UX affects trust long after the checkout flow. Clear pricing, visible contract details, and an accessible cancellation path do not weaken a business model. They create a product experience users can understand, recommend, and return to.",

          summary:
            "Bodique is a digital twin and virtual try-on experience designed to reduce fashion returns by showing customers their actual size fit before purchase — addressing one of retail's biggest problems: size-related return rates.",

          challenge:
            "The challenge was addressing a real business problem with high complexity. Fashion has one of the highest return rates, mainly due to fit uncertainty, while users still expect speed, convenience, and trust. At the same time, the team had to align different understandings of the product, manage time pressure, and keep the process structured despite fast project shifts.",

          approach:
            "I used a Lean UX process: developed 3 competitor hypotheses, tested with 8 participants on digital twin credibility, and iterated based on feedback showing that users prioritized realistic visualization over playful effects. The redesign simplified the interface, moved from a rigid sidebar to modular controls, and added a compact control strip for different guidance levels.",

          creativeDirection:
            "Bodique is positioned as a precise fitting assistant, not a fashion gimmick or tech showcase. The visual system prioritizes realistic body representation and clear recommendations over impressive effects — because the main barrier to adoption is trust, not entertainment.",
          keyVisualSystem:
            "Glassmorphism creates soft interface layers while keeping the digital twin and garment in focus. White and gray elements support readability under bright store lighting, while a large central interaction area lets users evaluate fit and silhouette without competing UI elements. Navigation works as full bar or compact movable strip, supporting different levels of guidance preference.",
          result: [
            "Validated Core Value: Users understood the digital twin concept and saw strong potential for reducing size related returns.",
            "Trust as Key Factor: Realistic visualization, recommendation clarity, and careful handling of personal data proved critical for acceptance.",

          takeaway:
            "In fashion, realistic visualization earns trust faster than impressive technology. Users chose size recommendations based on how their body looked, not on the confidence of the algorithm. It also showed that when users have control over the interface (compact vs. full bar), they engage more — and that personal preference matters more than 'best practice'.",

          summary:
            "Memory loss shouldn't mean losing connection - For individuals living with dementia and their families, staying in touch and maintaining a daily routine is both essential and increasingly difficult. MemoWe was designed to bridge that gap — offering a product that supports both patients and their loved ones without adding complexity to already demanding lives.",
          challenge:
            "Designing for users with dementia requires an entirely different standard of clarity. Cognitive load, visual noise, and inconsistent patterns are not just inconveniences — they are genuine barriers. At the same time, the product needed to serve family members who may be less tech-savvy or emotionally overwhelmed. The challenge was creating a single, unified experience that felt intuitive, warm, and reliable for both audiences simultaneously.",
          approach:
            "I led the full product design from architecture to interface, grounding every decision in cognitive accessibility principles. Warm color palettes, high-contrast layouts, predictable navigation, and a daily routine feature were designed to reduce cognitive load and give patients a sense of stability and control.",
          creativeDirection:
            "MemoWe is a calm support system rather than a medical tool or productivity app. The experience had to help people with dementia and their families feel guided, connected, and safe without adding emotional or cognitive pressure. The visual system therefore relies on warm colours, high contrast, familiar patterns, large readable elements, and predictable flows. I avoided complex dashboards, clinical aesthetics, and feature-heavy navigation because they would increase stress for users who need reassurance and repetition. The key judgement was to design around trust before functionality, making every interaction feel simple enough to return to and meaningful enough to support daily connection.",
          keyVisualSystem:
            "Turquoise (#00A099) creates a clear, recognizable structure without falling into clinical health-tech aesthetics. Light orange accent adds warmth and emotional balance, while glassmorphism supports soft, approachable interface layers that feel modern but not overwhelming. Large readable elements, high contrast, and repeated patterns support recognition and reduce navigation uncertainty.",
          result: [
            "End-to-End Product Ownership: Led full product design from information architecture to final interface.",
            "Accessibility-First Structure: Daily routine features and simplified navigation gave patients stability; warm colors and high contrast reduced visual stress. ",
            "User Feedback Integration: Early testing with families revealed need for predictable patterns and large touch targets — incorporated throughout.",

          ],
          takeawayTitle: "Takeaway",
          takeaway:
            "MemoWe demonstrates my ability to design for high-stakes, emotionally sensitive contexts where clarity and empathy are not optional. Building a product that genuinely supports vulnerable users — and the people caring for them — is one of the most meaningful challenges a designer can take on",

          summary:
            "PikBre is an expressive ambient remote control designed to be visible and playful in gaming environments — balancing functional symbols with a memorable sculptural identity that blends into a collector's space.",
          challenge:
            "Delivering a complete product design process within a tight five-week window, alongside other academic commitments, required both disciplined time management and clear team coordination. Beyond logistics, the real design challenge was developing a coherent visual and functional language for an everyday object — one where every formal decision needed to be grounded in design theory, from aesthetic principles to sign and symbol function.",
          approach:
            "I led the form exploration and interaction logic, using a Pikmin-inspired flower silhouette to make the remote feel like a collectible object instead of a generic peripheral. Black body with green illumination creates a gaming-room aesthetic, while honeycomb controls and leaf-shaped buttons communicate function through object language before interaction.",

          creativeDirection:
            "PikBre is positioned as an expressive ambient controller, not a neutral household remote — treating the object as a visible design presence in gaming spaces rather than something to be hidden.",
          keyVisualSystem:
            "Black body and green illumination reference gaming peripherals and gaming culture, while the flower-like silhouette makes the remote feel collectible and character-driven. Form follows function: honeycomb controls area, leaf-shaped buttons, and glowing power signal create symbolic cues without relying on conventional remote layouts — making the object readable and memorable.",
          result: [
            "Form Language: Designed a flower-inspired silhouette and honeycomb controls that make the remote feel like an expressive object, not a neutral tool.",

Traditional lists work linearly, but in AR/VR, poorly structured overlays can feel cluttered, distracting, or confusing.

Key items appear in the primary field of view, while lower-priority tasks float around peripheral zones, fading dynamically. Gestures and eye-tracking let users move, expand, or mark tasks complete intuitively. Contextual reminders attach to objects in the physical space, linking digital tasks to real-world triggers.

            "The creative direction positions Spatial To-Do as a spatial productivity layer rather than a list placed inside AR or VR. The experience had to make tasks feel present, prioritized, and connected to the user’s environment without creating visual clutter. The visual system relies on floating task objects, depth-based hierarchy, peripheral fading, subtle urgency cues, and gesture-led interaction to support focus in three dimensions. I avoided dense overlays and screen-like layouts because they would fight against immersion and increase cognitive load. The key judgement was to use space as a functional structure, turning task management into something users can see, arrange, and act on naturally.",

          challenge:
            "Designing an onboarding experience that communicates privacy clearly to non-technical users while respecting regional expectations. German users expect precision, control, and compliance with strict privacy standards like GDPR, but the interface also needed to feel approachable and intuitive for international audiences. Users often hesitate at first because health data is sensitive, and poor explanations can reduce adoption. ",
          approach:
            "I layered information to balance simplicity and depth. Permissions are grouped by type and impact, highlighting the required versus optional data. Security practices like encryption, secure storage, and two-factor authentication are explained through visual cues and plain-language animations rather than technical jargon. Microcopy reassures users at each step, using culturally familiar language and references for the German audience while maintaining clarity for international users. Interactive walkthroughs let users preview and adjust settings before completing onboarding, and default settings prioritize privacy. ",

            "The creative direction positions HealthyStart as a trust-building onboarding experience rather than a permission checklist. The product had to make sensitive health data feel understandable, controlled, and protected from the first interaction. The visual system uses layered explanations, clear permission groups, calm microcopy, plain-language security cues, and privacy-first defaults to reduce hesitation without hiding important details. I avoided legalistic copy, technical security dashboards, and fear-based messaging because they would create distance instead of confidence. The key judgement was to make privacy feel actionable, showing users what happens to their data before asking for commitment.",
